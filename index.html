                <p>Twenty years ago, readers around the world first discovered the magical story of Harry Potter,
                    created by J.K. Rowling. We can now reveal that, since that moment, half a billion Harry Potter
                    books have now been sold. On average, this means one in fifteen people in the world owns a Harry
                    Potter book. The 500 million sales are across the seven books in the series and the three</p>

                    First published by Bloomsbury in 1997, the books have now been translated into over 80 different
                    languages across the world, with more to come. From Albanian to Azerbaijani to Hebrew to Hawaiian,
                    the stories are becoming accessible to more people all the time.

            <h3>Godric Gryffindors Wand Resurfaces At Hogwarts</h3>
            <p>Earlier today Kaitlyn Byers, a 4th year from Ravenclaw, discovered what is now thought to be Godric
                Gryffindors Wand. While the magical item is currently being housed by The Ministry of Magic and
                undergoing tests to confirm its origin, how the wand made it into the hands of a student is quite
                astonishing.</p>
